# Product Requirements Document
## Centralized GitHub Workflow Management System

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025  
**Status:** Draft  
**Author:** Engineering Team  

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the requirements for implementing a centralized GitHub workflow management system that eliminates duplicate workflow maintenance across multiple repositories while enabling dynamic configuration and prompt management for AI-powered code reviews.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
Currently, maintaining AI-powered PR review workflows across multiple repositories requires updating each workflow file individually when improvements are made. This creates:
- **Maintenance overhead**: O(n) complexity for updates across n repositories
- **Version inconsistency**: Different repos may run different versions
- **Configuration drift**: Settings diverge over time
- **Slow iteration**: Updates require PRs to every repository

### 1.3 Solution Overview
Implement a centralized workflow system using GitHub's reusable workflows feature, combined with external configuration management and automated propagation mechanisms.

---

## 2. Goals and Objectives

### 2.1 Primary Goals
- **Reduce maintenance overhead by 90%** through centralization
- **Enable instant prompt updates** without workflow modifications
- **Maintain version consistency** across all repositories
- **Support repository-specific customization** without code duplication

### 2.2 Success Metrics
| Metric | Current State | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------------|--------|-------------------|
| Time to update all workflows | 2-4 hours | < 5 minutes | Deployment logs |
| Workflow version consistency | ~60% | > 95% | Automated scanning |
| Mean time to propagate changes | 1-2 days | < 1 hour | CI/CD metrics |
| Repository onboarding time | 30 minutes | < 5 minutes | Setup documentation |
| Prompt update frequency | Weekly | Daily+ | Git commit history |
